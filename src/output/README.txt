most files are probably too large to display in your browser (if you left click them)
instead, download the file by right clicking then "Save Link As..."

note: right now it only extracts TextAsset assets from resources.assets

important files are:
    * current/build_hash.txt
    * current/log.txt
    * merged/objects.xml    (Objects.xml)
    * merged/ground.xml     (GroundTypes.xml)


TODO:
    * extract sprites
    * diff
    * testing
